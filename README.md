# Dynamic Nonparametric Clustering of Multivariate Panel Data
Code to reproduce the results of Dynamic Nonparametric Clustering of Multivariate Panel Data (Custodio Jo√£o, Schaumburg, Lucas and Schwaab, 2022, Journal of Financial Econometrics, <https://doi.org/10.1093/jjfinec/nbac038>).

Running `Simulate_clustering.py` will generate a csv files with simulations results. This is used by `Simulation_plots.py` to reproduce Figure 5 of the paper.

`elastico.py` constains all functions needed for the clustering algorithm.
`simulate_fcts.py` contain the function that simulates the data.

`elastico.py` can be used to cluster other datasets. Typical usage might be:
```
model = el.CLModel(data, ident)
H = model.elastic(epsilon=epsilon)
```
where `epsilon` is the stickyness parameter, `data` is a numpy 2-way array with columns for variables and rows for observations, and the `ident` list of lists contains the indices $(i, t)$ of each row. For example, if $N=2$, $T=3$, and the number of dimensions $D=4$, these could be:
```
data = np.array([[0.7, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9],
                 [0.1, 1. , 0.1, 0.6],
                 [0. , 0.5, 0.9, 0.5],
                 [0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.5],
                 [0. , 0. , 0.4, 0.5],
                 [0.7, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7]])
ident = [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2],
         [1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]
```
